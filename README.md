# HR Analytics Dashboard Project

#Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging Tableau to analyze and visualize Human Resources data, aiming to provide actionable insights into key HR metrics such as employee demographics, performance, compensation, attrition, and engagement. The project highlights how data-driven approaches can be used to enhance workforce management, improve employee satisfaction, and optimize HR strategies.

## Objectives

Understand Workforce Composition: Analyze employee demographics, including gender distribution, age groups, and department-wise headcount.

Assess Performance Metrics: Evaluate performance ratings, training effectiveness, and promotion trends.

Analyze Compensation Trends: Identify salary distribution, overtime pay trends, and fairness in compensation.

Monitor Attrition Rates: Explore attrition trends, reasons for employee turnover, and department-wise attrition rates.

Enhance Employee Engagement: Study work-life balance and job satisfaction scores to propose strategies for boosting employee engagement.
